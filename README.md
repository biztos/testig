# Testig -- Go Test Helpers

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/biztos/testig?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/biztos/testig)

## What?

Helpers for Go testing.  May they help you thoroughly test your Go code!

The name `testig` is a pun in two languages, as well as an experiment in
misspelling.

## Why?

I find myself with shared testing code across projects, which I do not wish
to have scattered about like that.  Also, you may find it useful in your own
projects.

Note that some of this stuff may eventually be merged into other packages
(see below); or may be marked *deprecated as dumb* if I find something much
better.

## Who?

(c) 2016 Kevin Frost; BSD license (cf. the `LICENSE` file).

This package leans *heavily* on the [assert][1] package by Mat Ryer and Tyler
Bunnel (et al.), without which I probably wouldn't have even stuck with Go
long enough to care about this. Thanks [guys][2]!
